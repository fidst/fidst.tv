					<h2>Why?</h2>
					<p>Often times when dealing with a situation, the 'what' is the primary focus.<br> What is happening? <br> This of course leads to, 'How do we fix the <i>what</i>?'<br> It is often forgotten to think of <i>why</i> you are attempting to fix the problem
						in the first place. <br> 'Why are we fixing this?' 'Why did this problem come up in the first place?'<br><br> These questions can easily break the problem into smaller paths to take that can lead to a more thorough solution in the end.</p>

					<h2>Relate</h2>
					<p>When working with an individual, or a larger corporate problem that requires a solution to be found, it can be beneficial to find some way to relate to the problem.<br>
This can be as little as having a corrupt flash drive, to poor wifi connection in the corner room of the building. Finding a way, any way to relate it to your own life allows you to think of ways you have resolved the problem, or would prefer it resolved if it were you in their shoes.<br><br>
I have found verbally relating a life experience to clients helps them calm down as well. This can help your communication and resonate with them on a personal level, allowing the communication to be full and honest from both parties.</p>

					<h2>Prevent</h2>
					<p>Prevention comes after a solution is found. This is like putting the final layer on your funfetti birthday cake. You already have the delicious cake ready to go, but how do you make it better?<br>
					Chances are you do not want to have to deal with the situation again. You do not want to hear back from the same person who lost their data because they continued to carry their external hard drive in a wet paper bag from the grocery store.<br>
				You would prefer not to make an entirely new network plan for the office because you did not take into account the sudden possible growth the company would have in seven months.<br><br>
			Tell the sweet old lady to use a soft carry pouch and always unhook the cable before transport, include instructions on how to safely eject it to not corrupt her pictures of her nineteen grandchildren.<br>
		Allow for extra Ethernet drops, or extra wireless nodes to be implemented when the time comes.</p>
